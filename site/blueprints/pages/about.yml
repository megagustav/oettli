# Each page blueprint must have a title, the title may be different from the file name
title: About us

# Each page can have an icon that is shown in page listings when no preview image is available.
icon: ☎️

# We use tabs here to focus on the layout in one tab
# and have the additional contact fields in a secondary
# tab. Tabs can really help to clean up the interface
# when it otherwise gets too complicated
tabs:
  content: tabs/content
  # contact: tabs/contact
  seo: tabs/seo

# Each page blueprint must have a title, the title may be different from the file name
title: Home

# Each page can have an icon that is shown in page listings when no preview image is available.
icon: üè†

# Page options allow you to control how users can interact with the page.
# Here we prevent changing the page status (the home page cannot be renamed or deleted by default)
# More about page options: https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/blueprints/page#options

  changeStatus: false

# We use tabs here to focus on the layout in one tab
# and have the additional contact fields in a secondary
# tab. Tabs can really help to clean up the interface
# when it otherwise gets too complicated
tabs:
  # The contact tab pre-defines a set of address
  # fields for the contact box at the bottom of the about
  # page. Combining modular content from layouts with
  # pre-defined content from such fields is a great way to
  # offer flexibility and yet keep certain constraints.
  #
  # The form layout is created with two columns,
  # each column has a set of fields
  # More about columns:

  home:
    # Here we define an info section and a pages section (`photography`)
    sections:

    # The photography section extends a pages section defined in the `/site/blueprints/section/album.yml` blueprint
